# README.md AST2000 project

This repository is unfortunately rather messy due to having been copied over from several years ago, before I learned how to structure things, just to display as a completed project

The blog the `Blog Part X`-folders source to can be found here: https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST2000/h17/theodor-blogg/

The source code for the project is contained in one monolithic class in GOOD_BIG_SPECIAL_PROJECT.py, and is implemented to satisfy the criteria for each part in each particular Part_X.py. There are some very nice images and videos hidden around this place (courtesy of the AST2000 simulation software, whose name I do not recall) such as a video of a sunrise on a foreign planet in Blog part 6, or the gifs of the deep-space view the pictures folder.

The monolith source code had some good structure (although not necessarily showing any form of standardization regarding naming and formatting), but as far as I can recall it was mostly torn apart in the zealous hunt for bugs
